1. What are the two types of Intents?\
  a)	}Explicit Intents: have specified a component (via SetComponent(ComponentName) or setClass(Context, Class)), which provides the exact class to be run

  b)	}Implicit Intents: have not specified component, instead, they must include enough information for the system to determine which of the available components is best to run for intent

2. Which of the two types of Intents are more secure?

Explicit is more secure because it specify the exact component to start. Whereas, Implicit intents are used when we do not know what component to start

3. What type of Intent is shown on lines 69 to 73 of SecondFragment.kt? 
  a) Implicit 

4. What type of Intent is shown on lines 68 to 70 of ThirdFragment.kt?\
  a)Explicit because it specifies the component to start 

5. Which of these two Intents is the proper way to do an Intent?\
Whenever possible, it should be Explicit Intents

As the last question above hinted, one of these two Intents is not correct. Fix the incorrect Intent, then in 3 sentences or less discuss in difference.txt which file you modified and why.\

The below intent is the incorrect one, because it uses Implicit Intent to start the browser\

var intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)\
                        intent.type = "text/giftcards_browse"\
                        intent.data = Uri.parse("https://appsecclass.report/api/index")\
                        intent.putExtra("User", loggedInUser);\
                        startActivity(intent)\

   b) To correct this, I removed lines 69 to 73 of SecondFragment.kt and pasted:\

var intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java)\
                        intent.putExtra("User", loggedInUser);\
                        startActivity(intent)\

I remove the original intent because it was implicit intent, which is less secure than an explicit intent}
